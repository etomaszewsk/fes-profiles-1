# FES mdEditor Profiles

The mdEditor program allows users to create metadata for a wide variety of data types, which results in edit sessions displaying many more fields than a user will need for the data they are describing. Profiles in mdEditor allow users to hide fields that are not needed for their metadata. 

FES Profiles are created for mdEditor users within USFWS Alaska Region Fisheries and Ecological Services program in order to create a more streamlined metadata creation process.
